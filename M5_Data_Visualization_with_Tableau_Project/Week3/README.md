# Milestone 3: Exploratory Analysis

## Introduction
In this milestone, you will use the skills that you have learned in the specialization to perform exploratory analysis of your data. You will identify key metrics in the data and create KPIs, and you will use those KPIs to create dashboards that allow for comparative views and “brushing and linking.” This will allow us to begin to think about the proper context of developing an explanatory analysis that will form the basis for the remaining milestones. Be sure your visualizations demonstrate the visual and cognitive design principles learned throughout the Specialization, and make use of advanced features like hierarchies, actions, filters and parameters.

## Learning Objectives
* Perform exploratory analysis.
