# Getting Started and Milestone 1: Develop a Project Proposal

## Introduction
In this first milestone, you will write a project proposal that will capture the “who, what, why and how” of your project plus any challenges that you foresee along the way. Your proposal will include: a specific business case or personal objective, any intended outcomes, a description of the needs of the intended audience, a description of the dataset to be used, and any foreseeable challenges.

## Learning Objectives
* Develop a project proposal.
* List any challenges.
* Describe the needs of the audience
