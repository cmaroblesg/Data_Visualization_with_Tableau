# Getting Started and Milestone 1: Develop a Project Proposal

## Introduction
In this first milestone, you will write a project proposal that will capture the “who, what, why and how” of your project plus any challenges that you foresee along the way. Your proposal will include: a specific business case or personal objective, any intended outcomes, a description of the needs of the intended audience, a description of the dataset to be used, and any foreseeable challenges.

## Learning Objectives
* Develop a project proposal.
* List any challenges.
* Describe the needs of the audience
* Describe the dataset.

## Readings
* For your assignments in this course, you will be working with Tableau Desktop, but will need to publish your workbooks to Tableau Public. To do this, please see this article: [Publish Workbooks to Tableau Public](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/publish_workbooks_tableaupublic.html)
