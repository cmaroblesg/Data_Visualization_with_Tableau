# Developing a Project Proposal

## Instructions:
For this milestone, you will create a project proposal that will capture the “who, what, why and how” of your project, plus any challenges that you foresee along the way.

## Review criteria
Specifically, your project proposal will be graded by your peers according to your ability to document the following information:
* Description of your topic of interest and why you chose it
* The business case or personal objective of the project
* Any specific outcomes the project must accomplish
* Persona document(s) that capture the needs of the intended audience(s)
* A description of the dataset to be used, including an explanation of why you * chose this data and how you might present your findings
* Any foreseeable challenges

## Project Proposal
You will need to thoroughly examine those suggestions in the design checklist to help build out your project proposal. Your proposal needs to include:

* **Executive Summary.** You will need to write a 50-100 word executive summary that introduces your topic and why you chose it.
* **Why.** You will need to clearly identify the objectives/business case/goal of your project. Remember this will keep you focused. You will also need to identify any specific outcomes the project must accomplish, if any.
Who. You will need to identify who your final presentation is intended for: stakeholders, audience, subject-matter experts, a combo, or other? You will create a persona document for each "Who" you have identified and the goals of each user (see more information below on creating a persona).
* **What.** You will need to identify your dataset (see more information on selecting data below) and describe why you chose the data set you chose.
* **How.** Once you have identified the other elements, provide an initial opinion as to how you think you present your findings. This will obviously evolve as you move through the milestones.
* **Challenges.** Your proposal should conclude with any foreseeable challenges you are expecting to face and areas you hope to gain more experience. Include specific questions for your peers in this area.

## Creating Persona Document(s)
To begin creating your persona document(s), we recommend you begin by reading the information about [Persona development provided by usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html). Though primarily written for web-oriented projects, this website provides a good primer on considerations for creating Persona documents for a wide range of uses.

For another, more marketing-oriented view on Persona development, we recommend reading the article called [The Complete, Actionable Guide to Marketing Personas, at Buffer Social](https://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide). This article provides good information and several useful links for further exploration of these topics.  

Finally, for a more advanced look at Persona development, consult this article from [UXPin on creating “empathy maps”](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-practical-guide-to-empathy-maps-creating-a-10-minute-persona/), which presents a version of Personas heavily steeped in User Experience (UX) methodologies.

For this project, your Persona document(s) must capture the following information about your audience or audience segments:
* Name, age, gender
* A representative photo
* Goals of the user relative to your visualization or data story
* Challenges and needs of the user relative to your visualization or data story
* Context in which the user will view or interact with the visualization or data story
* (Optional) Any other relevant notes

Attached are two examples of Persona documents.

## Guidelines for Selecting a Dataset

At this stage, you may have already identified the dataset you would like to use. Or, you may need to evaluate several data sources to determine what will best meet your needs. Either way, it is important to clearly identify the objectives of the project as well as the intended audience up front in order to select the appropriate data that will best meet the needs of your project. In selecting your data, you should follow these guidelines:

1. The data has to have data available and be usable (ie, .csv data).
2. The data should have clean dates and times.
3. The data should **not** have any problematic outliers, but if it does have outliers, you need to become familiar with what that might mean.
4. The data should be relevant to your project's goal/business case.
5. You should have permission to use the data and be able to post it publicly on 6. Tableau Public as it is the only way to share your visualizations for peer feedback.
