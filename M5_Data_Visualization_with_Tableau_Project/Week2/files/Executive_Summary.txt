One of the most important task in the Data Analysis is to get a database to be used and analyzed. For this particular project, It is using the COVID-19 reported cases.
This information can download free directly from the source: https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico
Moreover, to understand and process the information it is also necessary to download the data dictionaries: http://datosabiertos.salud.gob.mx/gobmx/salud/datos_abiertos/diccionario_datos_covid19.zip

The main goal of this project is to create a lockdown semaphore to stop non-essential activities in the country group by state.
The database contains all the reported cases in the region. The local government created a database in which the hospitals, clinics, laboratories and other health building report the cases daily.
Moreover, this dataset contains not only the positive cases, it contains also negative and false detections.

Thus, the first part is related to the extraction of the positive-confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Then, join the catalogues to the database to fully understand the content.
The third part is to clean the database, this process includes the correction of typos, misspelling and grammar in the fields, convert date fields into date-stamps format, eliminate repetitions and blank spaces and convert some columns into numeric information.
Finally, the information is stored into a *.csv file format and uploaded into Tableau.
