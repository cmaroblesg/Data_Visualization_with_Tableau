## Introduction
Congratulations, you have made it to the final Milestone in this project-based course!  For this Milestone you will apply the final design elements that will make your viz or data story really come to life. By now you have identified the insights from your data (Milestone 3) and assembled them into a basic story arc, or draft visualization (Milestone 4). Now it is time to create the final design of your data story or viz.\
For this final step, we will bring back into focus the needs of the audience via the Persona document you created in Milestone 1. Your job here is to translate the needs and requirements captured in your project proposal and audience persona into specific design decisions. This is also your opportunity to refine specific elements as needed based on the feedback you received in the peer review process.\
You will apply the final design to your visualization or data story, using your persona document and project proposal as your guide. You will select three specific design elements from your final viz or data story, and explain why you made those choices in light of your audience. Put simply: your job is to design for your audience, and weâ€™ll want you to tell us how and why you arrived at the choices you did.\
As part of your submission, you will need to include your original project proposal
