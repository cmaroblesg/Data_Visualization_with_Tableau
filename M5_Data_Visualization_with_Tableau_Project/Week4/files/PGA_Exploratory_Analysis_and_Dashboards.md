# Peer-graded Assignment: Exploratory Analysis and Dashboards
## Instructions
Once we have the data pre-processed, we are ready to roll up our sleeves and begin exploring the data in earnest.  In this milestone you will use the skills that you have learned in the specialization to perform exploratory analysis of your data. You will identify key metrics in the data and create KPIs to track those metrics. We will use those KPIs to create dashboards that allow for comparative views and “brushing and linking” of the data. This will allow us to begin to think about the proper context of developing an explanatory analysis that will form the basis for the remaining milestones.\
Remember that at this point, your design decisions should be made to facilitate exploration of the data, so be sure your KPIs and worksheets demonstrate the visual and cognitive design principles learned in throughout the Specialization. In particular,  and make use of advanced features like hierarchies, actions, filters and parameters.

## Review criteria
You will submit a URL to your worksheets or dashboard on Tableau Public containing your KPIs (key metrics) for this project.
Your worksheets or dashboard must make use of at least one design principle and at least one KPI principle taught in this course.
You will also submit a written narrative answering specific questions.

### Tableau Public Visual
You will create worksheets with visuals within Tableau Desktop and share your URL on Tableau Public.
You will submit a URL to your worksheet or dashboard on Tableau Public containing your KPIs (key metrics) for this project.

Specifically, your peers will be looking for the following items in your submissions for this milestone:
* Use of at least one design principle covered in the Specialization, including, but not limited to: pre-attentive attributes; strategic use of color/contrast, shapes, or sizes; effective use of language, labeling and scales; or visual hierarchies.
* Your worksheets or dashboard must also make use of at least one KPI principle, including: thresholds, hierarchies, actions, filters, or parameters to guide interaction.

### Answer These Questions
Submit your answers to the following questions:
* Why are these KPIs key to answering your business question or achieving your project goals? What specific insight did these KPIs or worksheets provide you?
* How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one pre-attentive attribute?
* How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one of the following KPI principles?
* Do these worksheets meet the needs of your intended audience as-is? How might they need to be changed before ultimately being presented?

Also, include discuss your thoughts on the exploratory process in general.
* How long did you spend exploring your data?
* What did you learn about the process?
* How many visualizations did you end up having to create before honing in on the best one to represent your project goal?
* What surprised you and what did you find difficult?
