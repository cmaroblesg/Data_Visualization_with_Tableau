# Peer-graded Assignment: Exploratory Analysis and Dashboards
## Instructions
Once we have the data pre-processed, we are ready to roll up our sleeves and begin exploring the data in earnest.  In this milestone you will use the skills that you have learned in the specialization to perform exploratory analysis of your data. You will identify key metrics in the data and create KPIs to track those metrics. We will use those KPIs to create dashboards that allow for comparative views and “brushing and linking” of the data. This will allow us to begin to think about the proper context of developing an explanatory analysis that will form the basis for the remaining milestones.\
Remember that at this point, your design decisions should be made to facilitate exploration of the data, so be sure your KPIs and worksheets demonstrate the visual and cognitive design principles learned in throughout the Specialization. In particular,  and make use of advanced features like hierarchies, actions, filters and parameters.

## Review criteria
You will submit a URL to your worksheets or dashboard on Tableau Public containing your KPIs (key metrics) for this project.
Your worksheets or dashboard must make use of at least one design principle and at least one KPI principle taught in this course.
You will also submit a written narrative answering specific questions.

### Tableau Public Visual
You will create worksheets with visuals within Tableau Desktop and share your URL on Tableau Public.
You will submit a URL to your worksheet or dashboard on Tableau Public containing your KPIs (key metrics) for this project.

Specifically, your peers will be looking for the following items in your submissions for this milestone:
* Use of at least one design principle covered in the Specialization, including, but not limited to: pre-attentive attributes; strategic use of color/contrast, shapes, or sizes; effective use of language, labeling and scales; or visual hierarchies.
* Your worksheets or dashboard must also make use of at least one KPI principle, including: thresholds, hierarchies, actions, filters, or parameters to guide interaction.

### Answer These Questions
Submit your answers to the following questions:
* Why are these KPIs key to answering your business question or achieving your project goals? What specific insight did these KPIs or worksheets provide you?
* How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one pre-attentive attribute?
* How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one of the following KPI principles?
* Do these worksheets meet the needs of your intended audience as-is? How might they need to be changed before ultimately being presented?

Also, include discuss your thoughts on the exploratory process in general.
* How long did you spend exploring your data?
* What did you learn about the process?
* How many visualizations did you end up having to create before honing in on the best one to represent your project goal?
* What surprised you and what did you find difficult?

**Questions**\
**Why are these KPIs key to answering your business question or achieving your project goals? What specific insight did these KPIs or worksheets provide you?**
The KPIs shows the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the country, the current number of active illed people and the number of deaths.

**How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one pre-attentive attribute?**
The dashboard is focus on the user interaction. For that reason, the user can highlighted the two principal block, the map that show the lockdown semaphore and the number of confirmed cases by month.

**How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one of the following KPI principles?**
The dashboard colored based on the active cases in the region and displayed the same color for the active, confirm and mortal cases.

**Do these worksheets meet the needs of your intended audience as-is? How might they need to be changed before ultimately being presented?**
The dashboard shows the lockdown semaphore by state based on the active cases in the region. This is the main goal of this analysis. Nevertheless, it is necessary to understand who are the most affected and create a vaccination campaign to demise the propagation rate.

**How long did you spend exploring your data?**
Exploring the data consumes 4 to 6 hours, because the information on the downloaded information is not completed and require to add the catalogues to understand the reported data.

**What did you learn about the process?**
The data exploratory phase is very important and gives you a full view on what you will find in the data. On the other hand, it also helps to challenge the current upload process and create a better procedure.

**How many visualizations did you end up having to create before honing in on the best one to represent your project goal?**
At the end, I’ve created almost 8 visualizations. But, ini the dashboard I only using the best 5 due to the information it displayed.

**What surprised you and what did you find difficult?**
The most difficult part is creating the interactivity with the data, and I surprised the database information, because it contains lot of details about the registered people and the laboratory tests. Moreover, we have to highlight that the database structure requires minimum changes on the content, such as the dates.
