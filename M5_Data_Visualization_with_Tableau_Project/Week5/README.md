# Milestone 4: Storytelling and Storyboarding
## Introduction
In this milestone, you will take a short but essential break from the data visualization software and begin to give structure to your data stories. You will define the basic story arc of your data story, or draft a narrative description of what your data visualization communicates. You have started that process in the previous milestones, but now we will start assembling our story using Story Points.
