# Peer-graded Assignment: Storyboarding and Storytelling
## Instructions
In this Milestone, you will pivot from a mindset of exploratory analysis to one of explanatory analysis. By now you have explored key elements of your data using KPI techniques, and you should have some insights or answers to present. Here is where we will give structure to those insights and answers in a way that creates a clear and compelling presentation of your findings. As mentioned previously, you have two options for your final deliverable - either a single-frame viz (or infographic), or a multi-frame data story using Story Points. To make this decision, you will need to consult your project proposal and your persona document from Milestone 1 and decide which of these formats will best suit the needs of your audience.

## If You Choose to Create a Multi-Frame Data Story
If you choose to create a multi-frame data story, you will use Story Points to assemble a draft of your data story based around the insights you have gleaned from your KPIs. You are free to use as many points as necessary to communicate your full story. Make sure you are captioning each point using the text boxes, and sequencing your points in the correct order. Remember, at this stage you are simply giving structure to your story elements - you will make your final design decisions in the next Milestone.  

**You have learned about the Three C’s: Context, Challenge, and Conclusion, but there are many other story arcs to explore, and we encourage you to branch out if needed. For further exploration of common data story elements, read these articles:**

**Specifically, your peers will be looking for the following elements in your submission:**
* A URL to your draft data story on Tableau Public.
* Use text boxes in Tableau Stories to create your story elements, based around the insights from your exploratory analysis. You may follow the Three C’s structure, or use another format, but your story should flow well and clearly communicate the findings from your analysis.
* A written explanation for why you chose to make a multi-frame data story, as opposed to a single-frame viz.

## If You Choose to Create a Single-Frame Visualization or Infographic
If you choose to create a single-frame visualization or infographic, you will use Tableau to create a draft visualization that answers your business question or achieves your goals for the project. You will also draft a narrative description of what your visualization communicates and what outcomes it aims to achieve. At this point, you may already have some of the visual elements in place for your final deliverable, or you may not. Regardless, your viz will not yet be in its final form, but it should clearly present the essential findings from your exploratory analysis.

We have included a few articles about creating great visualizations and infographics that concisely distill many of the techniques taught throughout this program. If you’re looking for more guidance, we recommend you start with these articles:

Specifically, your peers will be looking for the following elements in your submission:
* A URL to your visualiation or infographic on Tableau Public.
* How well does your viz or infographic articulate the findings from your analysis.
* Include a written explanation for why you chose a single-frame visualization or infographic as your final deliverable.

## Solution
**Submit your written explanation for why you chose to make a multi-frame data story or a single-frame visualization/infographic over the other option.**\
I've decided to use a single-frame visualization to focus the attention to the confirmed cases in the country as well as the lockdown semaphore that determines which activities remains open. Also, it is compared the most affected people by gender and age range. This analysis was made to analyse the posibility to create a vaccination campaign in order to demise the propagation along the country and the state.
The main difference is the interactivity with the user, meanwhile into multi-frame you need to create a whole story and focus the attention slide by slide. Into a single, frame the user focus its attention to the main view and can play with the dashboard.
