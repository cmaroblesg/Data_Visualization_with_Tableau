# Peer-graded Assignment: Designing a Visualization for Your Manager

## Instructions

The Sales - Superstore dataset contains detailed information about your company’s sales. Your manager, Sylvia, has made a decision to cut the three worst performing sub-categories in their region in terms of Sales. To do this, she has asked you to create one data visualization that will identify which three sub-categories are the worst performers by region, and show how much worse they perform than other sub-categories. Sylvia will use this visualization to inform which product categories to cut, and in which regions.

## Review criteria

For this assignment, you will first review the persona document for 
Sylvia to gain an understanding of her needs, goals and abilities.  You 
will then create a visualization from the Sales - Superstore data set 
that shows the worst performing sub-categories in each region, and 
how those worst performers compare to other sub-categories in that 
region. You must also identify the three worst performing sub-categories overall. 

Your visualization must demonstrate proper use of 
the design principles used in this course, specifically: “pop-out” or 
“pre-attentive” attributes, Gestalt Principles, cognitive load and 
clutter, and static or interactive format. You will be asked to explain 
how your design choices are a good match for Sylvia and how they will 
address her needs and goals in this context. 


If you don't already have one, you will need to create a Tableau Public profile to save your work. To create your profile, please follow the prompts at:https://public.tableau.com/s/


Your assignment is to submit a PDF document that shows your work for Parts B and C below

### Review Your Persona

Begin by reading the persona document about Sylvia, a VP of Sales at your company. Imagine she is your manager and consider how you can design a visualization that addresses her needs, goals and abilities.

### Create a Visualization

With your target audience identified, you will create a visual with her in mind. Be sure to apply the design principles you learned throughout the course, including at least one pre-attentive attribute, at least one Gestalt Principle, cognitive load and clutter, and whether the visualization should be static or interactive. Once you create your visualization, save it to your Tableau Public Profile and paste the URL pointing to your work into a PDF.

### Answer Your Managers Questions

Now that you have completed your visualization, use the following question prompts to explain how your design choices fit the needs, goals and abilities for your intended audience (Sylvia). You will need to provide your answers into the same PDF for submission.

* How does your visualization leverage at least one “pop-out effect” or “pre-attentive attribute?” Which one(s) was (were) chosen and why?
* How does your visualization utilize at least one Gestalt principle? Which principle(s) is (are) being reflected, and how?
* How does your design reflect an understanding of cognitive load and clutter?
* Is your visualization static or interactive? Why did you choose that format?
* What need does this visualization address that words or numbers alone cannot fill?
