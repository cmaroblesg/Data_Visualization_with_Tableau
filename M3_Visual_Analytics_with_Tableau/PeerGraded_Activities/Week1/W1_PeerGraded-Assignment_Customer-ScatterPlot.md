# Peer-graded Assignment: Customer Scatterplot
## Week 1

### Instructions:
Your company has tasked you with analyzing your customer’s purchases and how much the company is profiting from each customer. Your task is to create a scatter plot showing Customer Sales versus Customer Profit.  Furthermore, you will need to colorize your scatter plot by Profit Ratio, size your circles by Discount, add the customer’s name to the Tooltip, add a trend line, and add Order date, Segment, and Category to the filter.
