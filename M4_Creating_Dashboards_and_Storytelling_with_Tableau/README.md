# Creating Dashboards and Storytelling with Tableau

## About this Course
Leveraging the visualizations you created in the previous course, Visual Analytics with Tableau, you will create dashboards that help you identify the story within your data, and you will discover how to use Storypoints to create a powerful story to leave a lasting impression with your audience.\
You will balance the goals of your stakeholders with the needs of your end-users, and be able to structure and organize your story for maximum impact. Throughout the course you will apply more advanced functions within Tableau, such as hierarchies, actions and parameters to guide user interactions.  For your final project, you will create a compelling narrative to be delivered in a meeting, as a static report, or in an interactive display online.

## Readings:
* This recommended reading provides some scientific explanation for why and how humans make decisions for reasons other than pure logic and facts.  Emotion, behavioral factors, and psychological factors also play an important role in decision making, and this article touches on why we believe that to be true.

* This article examines the intersection of emotion and storytelling in the context of human decision making.  While this article focuses on the marketing context, much of the underlying information is true for storytelling across all disciplines.
