## Readings:
* [whitepaper_mustdosofmarketingdashboards_eng_3.pdf](./files/whitepaper_mustdosofmarketingdashboards_eng_3.pdf)
* This is a well known primer on dashboards. What’s very nice about it is that there are a series of checklists that someone can use to ensure that their dashboard is ready to be presented.Juice Analytics, **A Guide to Creating Dashboards People Love to Use**, [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52f42657e4b0b3416ff6b831/t/5310292ce4b08d35a87c9426/1393568044420/Guide_to_Dashboard_Design.pdf](./files/Guide_to_Dashboard_Design.pdf)
* A Tableau centric perspective on how to create dashboards. It’s shorter  than the Juice Analytics one so it’s not quite as thorough, but it’s very  helpful to have the Tableau perspective. **Top 5 Best Practices for creating effective dashboards**, [https://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/whitepapers/dashboards-for-financial-services.pdf](./files/dashboards-for-financial-services.pdf)
* Kanter’s piece is very short and very nice because it has the perfect  distillation of the essentials of dashboard design. I recommend  bookmarking this. It is an older piece, but still very relevant. Kanter, Beth. **Dashboard Design Principles**, [http://www.bethkanter.org/dashboard-design/](http://www.bethkanter.org/dashboard-design/)
* Another short and sweet post that is more audience-centric than Kanter’s. **5 Key Principles of a Good Dashboard Design That We Need to Know**: [https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/good-dashboard-design-principles/](https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/good-dashboard-design-principles/)
