# Project Brief

Imagine you are an analyst working for the Super Store Corporation. Your boss Sylvia is the VP of Sales and she is conducting a review of the company discount policy. As research for her review, she has asked you to perform an exploratory analysis of the Super Store discount data. Specifically, Sylvia has asked you to investigate if there is a relationship between discounted sales and profit, and how much the company is profiting or losing based on discounted sales.

She also wants to see if there are opportunities for efficiencies with respect to how discounts are handled. Perhaps certain customers are receiving more discounts than other customers. Perhaps certain product categories or product segments are receiving more discounts than others. Sylvia has given you wide latitude to explore this question however you see fit, and will ultimately make a recommendation to the board of directors based on your findings.

At the end of each module in this course, you will complete discussions and assignments that will build on each other for your final artifact. Here is what you can expect in each module:
* Module 1: You will first create a design checklist to guide your exploration of the data and your design decisions for the final deliverables.
* Module 2: You will then explore the data and create KPIs to track key indicators and identify meaningful relationships.
* Module 3: You will draft the narrative arc of your analysis, using the Three C’s of Context, Challenge and Conclusion.
* Module 4: You will create the final deliverables for Sylvia to present your analysis to company stakeholders. Sylvia will ultimately be presenting these findings both on handouts as a single-frame visualization, and in a multi-slide Story Points presentation to board members. The single-frame visualization will be included on hand-outs in the board meeting.  

Sylvia will have only 5-7 minutes to present to board members, and she knows that her board members don’t understand the minutiae of the business and prefer quickly hearing only the top-level facts. She also knows the room the presentation will be held in is large, meaning the visualization will be viewed from a great distance across the room. Please consult the Persona document included in this project for specific requirements of this audience.
